/**
 * User-facing Frame Graph. Each {@link View3D} owns one — the graph
 * is bound to the view's Context3D in the constructor and uses that
 * view as the implicit owner for setup contexts and pass execution.
 *
 * Pass lifecycle:
 *
 *   graph.add(MyPass, ...args)
 *     → new MyPass(...args)            // ctor: nothing GPU
 *     → (defer; setup runs at compile)
 *     → graph.compile() (lazy)         // setup → validator → topoSort
 *       → pass.setup(builder)          // declares reads/writes/creates
 *     → pass.execute(ctx)              // each frame, in topo order
 *     → pass.destroy()                 // on graph.destroy() or remove()
 *
 * Setup is **deferred** to `compile()` and runs with a transactional
 * builder + multi-round iteration: a pass that reads a resource (or
 * uses an RT) declared by another not-yet-set-up pass throws an
 * internal `_PendingSetupError`, its draft is discarded, and the pass
 * is retried after other passes commit their declarations. This makes
 * `add()` call order irrelevant — the topo sort still ultimately
 * picks the right execute order from the declared reads/writes/deps.
 *
 * The graph collects `b.read` / `b.write` calls into the pass's
 * `reads` / `writes` / `creates` arrays during setup, freezing them
 * at commit time. See {@link RenderGraphPass} for the contract.
 *
 * ## Hot-swap contract
 *
 * Mutations are safe at any time between frames. Each one marks the
 * graph dirty so the next `compile()` rebuilds; wrap a sequence of
 * mutations in {@link beginUpdate} / {@link endUpdate} to coalesce.
 *
 * | Op | Effect on validator | Effect on pool |
 * |----|---------------------|----------------|
 * | `add(Ctor)` | new pass joins validation + topo | pass's `b.write(name, getter)` registers `name` |
 * | `remove(name)` | pass leaves validation + topo; consumers of its outputs fail compile | pass's `creates` are unregistered |
 * | `replace(name, Ctor)` | old leaves, new joins | old `creates` unregistered, then new `setup()` registers |
 * | `disablePass(name)` | pass is filtered out as if removed | unchanged (getter stays for cheap `enablePass`) |
 * | `enablePass(name)` | pass re-enters validation + topo | unchanged |
 *
 * `disable === remove` for the validator's purposes — disabling a
 * producer whose output is read by an enabled pass throws
 * `UnresolvedResourceError` at the next compile, instead of silently
 * delivering stale data at execute. Disable is the right choice when
 * you intend to flip the pass back on; remove is right when you don't.
