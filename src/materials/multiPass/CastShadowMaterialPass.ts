        // Why not back-face (cullMode='front'), despite it eliminating
        // self-shadow moire: back-face cast stores the far side of each
        // caster in the shadow map, so any caster whose geometry extends
        // below / past its visual "base" on the receiver produces
        // peter-panning — the stored depth sits "behind" the receiver and
        // the receiver fragment compares as lit when it should be
        // shadowed. This is scene-authoring dependent (buried meshes,
        // intersecting receivers, clipping-plane geometry) and users
        // cannot reasonably be expected to re-author every asset to
        // avoid it. Front-face cast is robust to scene content and
        // relies on the receiver-side pipeline to hide moire:

        // Trade-off: narrow self-shadow seams may still appear on
        // heavily tilted receivers under extreme main-camera zoom. If
        // a specific material needs back-face cast (e.g. thick solid
