## Orillusion

`Orillusion`  is a pure Web3D rendering engine which is fully developed based on the `WebGPU` standard. It aims to achieve desktop-level rendering effects and supports 3D rendering of complex scenes in the browser.

## Need to know
Beta version,  **NOT**  recommended for any commercial application.

## Contributing (ongoing)

`WebGPU` is the latest technology in the web domain and will play a crucial role in terms of 3D rendering as well as `AI/LLM` scenarios. 

We aim to create a dedicated technical community for the `WebGPU` field, bringing together outstanding developers. 

Hope more and more `front-end` developers could stay updated with the latest Web technologies `NOT ONLY` image slicing for web design.

Specifically, we will continuously update the excellent samples provided by open-source contributors, allowing everyone to see better works. 

Hope it could help highlight the very talented individual developers within the community!

## Install

### NPM
We recommend using front-end build tools for developing Web3D applications, such  [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

- Install dependencies:
```text
npm install @orillusion/core --save
```
- Import on-demand:
```javascript
import { Engine3D, Camera3D } from '@orillusion/core'
```
- Import globally:
```javascript
import * as Orillusion from '@orillusion/core'
```

### CDN
In order to use the engine more conveniently, we support to use native `<script>` tag to import `Orillusion`. Three different ways to import using the official `CDN` link:

- **Global Build:** You can use `Orillusion` directly from a CDN via a script tag:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@orillusion/core/dist/orillusion.umd.js"></script>
<script>  
    const { Engine3D, Camera3D } = Orillusion  
</script>
```
The above link loads the global build of `Orillusion`, where all top-level APIs are exposed as properties on the global `Orillusion` object.

-  **ESModule Build:** We recommend using the [ESModule](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) way for development. As most browsers have supported `ES` module, we just need to import the `ES` build version of `orillusion.es.js`
```html
<script type="module">  
    import { Engine3D, Camera3D } from "https://unpkg.com/@orillusion/core/dist/orillusion.es.js" 
</script>
```

- **Import Maps:** In order to manage the name of dependencies, we recommend using [Import Maps](https://caniuse.com/import-maps)

```html
<!-- Define the name or address of ES Module -->  
<script  type="importmap">  
{  
    "imports": { "@orillusion/core": "https://unpkg.com/@orillusion/core/dist/orillusion.es.js" }  
}  
</script>  
<!-- Customerized names could be imported -->  
<script  type="module">  
    import { Engine3D, Camera3D } from "@orillusion/core"
</script>
```

## Usage
### Create Engine3D instance

Use `Engine3D.init()` to create a new engine instance. Each call returns an independent instance — you can run multiple engines side-by-side in the same page.

```javascript
import { Engine3D } from '@orillusion/core' 
Engine3D.init().then((engine) => {
    // Next
})
```
As `Engine3D.init()` is asynchronous, we recommend using `async/await` in the code
```javascript
import { Engine3D } from '@orillusion/core'  
async function demo(){  
    const engine = await Engine3D.init();
    // Next 
}  
demo()
```
### Create canvas
By default, `Engine3D.init()` creates a `canvas` the same size as the window. You can also create a `canvas` manually using `<canvas>` with an `id`

```html
<canvas id="canvas" width="800" height="500" />
```
Then get the `<canvas>` by `id` and pass it to `Engine3D.init()` via `canvasConfig`

```javascript
import { Engine3D } from '@orillusion/core';  
let canvas = document.getElementById('canvas')  

const engine = await Engine3D.init({
    canvasConfig: { canvas }
})
```

## Editor
`editor/` is a scene editor that runs entirely in the browser: no install, no server. It is built from the engine source in this repository and published to GitHub Pages every time `main` is updated:

**https://gotzawal.github.io/canonical/**

- Create primitives, lights and empties, import `.glb` / `.gltf` models and textures (drag and drop onto the viewport works too)
- Move / rotate / scale with the gizmo (`W` `E` `R`), snapping, undo / redo, multi-select, grouping, hierarchy drag and drop
- Edit materials, lights, sky, exposure, bloom, ambient occlusion and fog
- Scenes autosave to the browser (imported files live in IndexedDB); `Ctrl+S` downloads a `.scene.json` with assets embedded, `Ctrl+O` opens one

Run it locally with `pnpm run editor` (http://localhost:8100). `pnpm run editor:build` writes the static site to `editor/dist`.

The Pages deployment is done by `.github/workflows/editor-pages.yml`. It needs a one-time setting: **Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source: GitHub Actions**.
